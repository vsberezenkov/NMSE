A native cross-platform version [is planned][cross-platform-plan].

## Opening a Save File

There are two ways to open a save file:

### Method 1: Open Save Directory (Recommended)

1. Click **File -> Open Save Directory** in the menu bar, or browse through the bar
2. NMSE will automatically detect your save file location
3. A list of available save slots will appear
4. Select the save slot you want to edit

### Method 2: Load Save File (Manual)

1. Click **File -> Load Save File**
2. Browse to the save file on your computer
3. Select the file and click **Open**

Use this method for PlayStation or Nintendo Switch saves that you've copied to your PC.

---

## Saving Your Changes

After making edits, save your changes using one of these methods:

- **File -> Save** - Overwrites the original file (a backup is created automatically)
- **File -> Save As** - Save to a new location without overwriting the original

> ⚠️ **Important:** While NMSE creates automatic backups, it's good practice to keep your own copy as well. Always keep a backup of your original save files before editing. 

### Restoring Backups

If something goes wrong, you can restore from a backup:

- **Edit -> Restore Backup (All)** - Restore all save slots from backup
- **Edit -> Restore Backup (Single)** - Restore just the current save slot

### Corvette Support

Corvette ships are supported with some special considerations:
- Corvettes work jankily in the game save data.
- Corvette ships have additional <kbd>Export</kbd> / <kbd>Import</kbd> and <kbd>Snapshot</kbd> buttons. Due to how corvettes work, you should summon your corvette and then set a new starship to primary before editing.
- NMS saves only store the Technology slots in the starship keys for your last actively docked Corvette(s). If you intend to edit a corvettes inventories, have it docked on your freighter or as your primary.
- Corvette inventory slots are reverse looked up from the base data to show the correct technology slots. If you don't see them, you need to cycle the corvette per above.
- NMSE has some safety prompts around these to help to guide you when editing corvette starships safely.

Each tab has the ability to unlock / lock all, unlock individually and filter the lists.

Platform rewards require the user settings MXML file to also be edited directly. It will auto find the file on supported platforms, if not browse to `GCUSERSETTINGSDATA.MXML` in the NMS `Binaries\SETTINGS\` directory

> 💡 **Tip:** Due to how the game works, Twitch drops and platform rewards, you need to set your game to offline before starting the game to unlock the rewards.

> 💡 **Tip:** You may also need to edit the platform rewards after launching the game (or lock the file from editing until after launch) due to how the game recreates the user settings MXML at runtime.

## Export Settings

The **Export Settings** tab lets you set up export naming conventions and file preferences.

| Export Extensions | Export Templates |
|------------|------------|
| <img src="../img/export-extensions.png"> | <img src="../img/export-templates.png"> |

Configure how exported files are named and what format they use. This is useful if you frequently export and share save data or maintain custom collections of your save data.

Use the help sub tab for variable references.

## Raw JSON Editor

The **Raw JSON Editor** tab provides direct access to the underlying save file data in a tree view.

### When to Use This

The Raw JSON editor is for **advanced users** who need to edit values that aren't exposed in the other tabs. It shows the complete save file structure as a navigable tree.

### How to Use

1. Navigate the tree by expanding nodes
2. Click on a value to edit it
3. Modify the value in the edit field
4. Press Enter to confirm the change

> 💡 **Tip:** The <kbd>Expand All</kbd> button will unfold up to half a million rows of keys and information depending on your saves age and density and can take a **very significant** amount of time to complete. It will warn you before you expand.

> ⚠️ **Caution:** Editing raw JSON values incorrectly can corrupt your save file. Only use this if you know what you're doing, and always keep a backup!

## Importing & Exporting Inventories

NMSE supports importing and exporting inventory data, making it easy to share loadouts with other players or make backups / inject into other items.

### Exporting

1. Navigate to the inventory you want to export (Exosuit, Ship, etc.)
2. Use the export function to save the inventory to a file

### Importing

1. Navigate to the target inventory
2. Use the import function and select your file
3. The items will be loaded into the inventory

### Compatibility

NMSE can import inventories, multi-tools, ships, etc. from multiple save editor formats via key-matching, so you can share loadouts even if your friends use different tools.<br>
Any keys that can be matched successfully will be imported.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where are my save files?

NMSE auto-detects save locations for Steam, GOG, and Xbox Game Pass. If auto-detect doesn't work, save files are typically located at:

- **Steam:** `%APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\`
- **GOG:** `%APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\`
- **Xbox Game Pass:** Search for `NMS` in the Xbox app data folder

### Can I edit PlayStation or Switch saves?

Yes! You'll need to transfer the save file to your PC first via the homebrew of your choice (PS4: Apollo, SaveWizard, etc. - Switch: JKSV, etc.), edit it with NMSE, then transfer it back. Use **File -> Load Save File** to open manually transferred saves.

### Will editing my save get me banned?

No Man's Sky does not have an anti-cheat system for save file editing. However, always use save editing responsibly and keep backups.<br>
We do not support or condone cheating or editing at the expense of others. Please be responsible!

### My save won't load - what do I do?

1. Make sure you're using the [latest version of NMSE][releases]
2. Check that your save is from a supported game version
3. Try restoring from a backup (**Edit -> Restore Backup**)
4. If the issue persists, [report a bug][issues-bug]

### Can I undo my changes?

You can restore from the automatic backup that NMSE creates when you save. Use **Edit -> Restore Backup** to go back to the last version before your edits.
